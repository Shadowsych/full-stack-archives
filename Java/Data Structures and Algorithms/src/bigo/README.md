# Big O
Big O notation refers to the time (how long) and space (memory) complexity for an algorithm.  
- Big O denotes the worst possible complexity for the algorithm
- Big O chooses the biggest complexity in a sequence
- Big O ignores constants
- Big O ignores addition or subtraction
- Big O is proportional per the size of n

A few examples of Big O functions and their time-space complexity are below.
