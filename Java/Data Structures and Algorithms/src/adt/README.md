# ADT (Abstract Data-Types)
Abstract Data Types are Objects created for programmers to use. The internal programming behind an ADT should be ignored, and only the implementation and documentation needs to be given for others to use.

# Generics
Generics allow for an Object to store any abstract data-type. It utilizes the diamond operator with a data-type inside of it: <DATA_TYPE>.  

An example of using Generics is the ArrayList; for example,  
`ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();`  
The variable `list` is an ArrayList that holds `Integer` variables.
