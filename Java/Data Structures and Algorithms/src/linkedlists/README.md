# Singly Linked List
A linear list that knows the first Node of the list.  

The first Node points to the next Node, and the next Node to the next next Node, and so on and so forth. Therefore, the list becomes linear.

# Circular Linked List
A list that contains the first and last Nodes of the list.  

The first Node points to the next Node, and the next Node to the next next Node, and so on and so forth. The last element points back to the first. Therefore, the list becomes circular.

# Doubly Linked List
A list that contains the first and last Nodes of the list.

The first Node points to the next Node, and the next Node can point to the next or previous Node, and the next next Node can point to the next or previous Node, and so on and so forth. Therefore, the list is linked on both sides (next or previous), so the list becomes doubly linked.
