# Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms is a very important concept to learn the foundations of thinking logically when programming.  
This concept is especially most important for programming interviews.  

### Prerequisites
Before learning Data Structures and Algorithms, it's essential to know the idea of "reference/pointer" and "value" semantics

Furthermore, a good foundation on Object Oriented Programming is also necessary to implement the data structures.  

### How to interpret Data Structures and Algorithms
The best way of understanding them is by visualizing them and drawing them out before programming it.  

Data Structures and Algorithms do not test you on memorization, instead it focuses on implementing real-world problems into programming solutions.
