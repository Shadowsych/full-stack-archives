# Linear Search
Linear Search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds the data.  

It follows a O(n) complexity and is best used on lists that are not in sorted order.  

# Binary Search
Binary Search cuts the Array into half by checking less than or greater the middle element, then it cuts in half again, and again, and again until it finds the data. Therefore, it's a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  

Divide-and-conquer algorithms are logarithmic, so it follows a O(log2(n)) complexity.  
Binary search is best used on lists that are in sorted order.

# Recursion
Recursion is calling a method inside itself. There must be a base-case to stop the recursive method or the program will throw a StackOverflow Runtime Error. The program stack holds the methods that are being run, so implementing a recursive method would increase the stack until it reaches the base-case then the stack calls finish.
