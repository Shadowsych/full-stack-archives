# Queue (First in, First Out)
Queues are similar to Stacks, but a Queue is open at both its ends. The rear end is used to enqueue (add), and the front end is used to dequeue (remove) elements to the Queue.  

Imagine a queue at the store. The first person in line is the first person to get out of line. This is FIFO. A person getting into line is "enqueued", and a person getting out of line is "dequeued".
