# Stack (Last in, First Out)
Stacks are similar to Queue, but a Stack is open only in the rear end. The rear end is used to push (add) and pop (remove) elements to the Stack.  

Imagine a stack of paper. The last piece put into the stack is on the top, so it is the first one to come out. This is LIFO. Adding a piece of paper is called "pushing", and removing a piece of paper is called "popping".
