# Spring
Spring is a web framework that allows you to create web applications in Java. It's a standard among large enterprises, and it's a
very useful framework to implement microservices.

This is an overview of how to use Spring with the following tools:
1. Spring Boot - initializes the boilerplate to a spring app, similar to `create-react-app`
2. Spring MVC - library that provides classes to follow the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture in Spring
3. JPA - API that persists data between Java objects and SQL databases
4. Thymeleaf - templating engine to render HTML in the server-side

### IDE Tools
These IDE tools are useful to code Spring projects in your preferred IDE (i.e Eclipse). You can install these plugins from your IDE's  marketplace.
