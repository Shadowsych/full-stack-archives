# NodeJS Basics
This folder represents the basic features of modern NodeJS, a server-side run-time for JavaScript.

# Commands
- Use "npm init" on a file folder to initiate the package.json file
- Use "node [FILE_NAME]" to start the web-server from a
specific JavaScript file

# Packages
- Use "npm install formidable --save" to install the file upload system and add it to the package.json
- Use "npm install mysql --save" to install the MySQL module and add it to the package.json
- Use "npm install mongodb --save" to install the MongoDB module and add it to the package.json (We don't use MongoDB in this tutorial)
