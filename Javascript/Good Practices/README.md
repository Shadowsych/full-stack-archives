# Good Functional Programming Practices
This folder contains information on good functional programming practices, especially with JavaScript.

It contains information on:  
- preventing callback hell (where you use a bunch of callbacks inside of each other)
- better handling object recreation (so that objects
don't have to be recreated in a loop, which is expensive)
- decomposing a redundant problems into functions
- and much more...

Also, it's a good idea to use linters such eslint and code formatters such as prettier so that it forces your code to follow a good style format.
- A good style guide to follow is the AirBnB style https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
