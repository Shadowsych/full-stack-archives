# Good Functional Programming Practices
This folder contains information on good functional programming practices, especially with JavaScript.

It contains information on preventing callback hell (where you use a bunch of callbacks inside of each other), better handling object recreation (so that objects
don't have to be recreated in a loop, which is expensive), and decomposing a redundant problems into functions.
