/* Similar to Java, allows us to import css files from internal/external sources */
/*Imports the 3 different css,scss, and sass files from the local file directory*/
@import 'import.css';
/*The reason as to why we have a _ in the file names is so that SaSS does not convert them into CSS files and
only use them to be imported by other files. These are called 'partials'*/
@import '_import.scss';
@import '_import.sass';

/*Now all the data from each files are imported and we can utilize the variables, mixins, placeholders in this file */
