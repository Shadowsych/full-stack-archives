# Flexbox
The godsend of all CSS positioning. The epitome of simple, but flexible positioning. The reason CSS developers don't have to pull their hair out from using weird CSS tricks to position elements.

Flexbox allows you to put HTML elements into adjustable boxes, which these boxes can be put into a parent div and positioned inside of that div.

# Relative and Absolute Position
If a parent element is relative and its child element is absolute, then you can position the child
element anywhere relative the parent element.

This is very helpful if we're trying to create position an element at the exterior of an element
or at the edges of the element.
