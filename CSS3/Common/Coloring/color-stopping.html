            width: 50px;

            background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 0%);

            height: 50px;
            background: linear-gradient(to right, red 25%, blue 25% 50%, green 50% 75%, yellow 75%);

    <p>Left-side of the div is red and the right-side of the div is blue. This is thanks to linear gradient!</p>
    <div id="red-blue">&nbsp;</div>

    <p>In this example, we use multi-position color stops with adjacent colors to make a red, blue, green, and yellow div.</p>
    <div id="red-blue-green-yellow">&nbsp;</div>
