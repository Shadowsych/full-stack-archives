# Python
This repository is programming with Python 3.

### pyenv
Python has a lot of versions (e.g. python3.3, python3.6, python3.9, etc.) and different programs need different versions to work properly.
Each python version has its own environemnt with its own set of dependencies, which can lead to complications. It's best to manage these python
versions using a version manager, so you can can use a program called [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to accomplish this for you.

Install `pyenv` using `brew install pyenv` on MacOS.
