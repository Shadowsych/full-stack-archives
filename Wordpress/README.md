### Installation
Wordpress uses Apache, PHP, and MySQL stack. For Mac, the best way to install this stack is with [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/), which is a local server environment for Mac Apache MySQL PHP (MAMP).

Once you start the MAMP server on the desktop app, visit the local MAMP landing page at http://localhost:8888/MAMP/.

To see your MySQL databases, go to the phpMyAdmin CP at http://localhost:8888/phpmyadmin.

Create a new database named "wordpress" on phpMyAdmin. Next, let's install Wordpress on your MAMP server, so download Wordpress from https://wordpress.org/download/. Then, place the wordpress folder inside of your MAMP/htdocs folder. Now visit http://localhost:8888/wordpress to setup Wordpress on your local machine!
