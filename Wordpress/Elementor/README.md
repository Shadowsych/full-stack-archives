### Installation
Install the "Astra" Wordpress theme and activate it for the website. The Astra template is a fast, fully customizable, and lightweight theme. It is one of the most popular wordpress themes that integrate well with Elementor. Other alternatives are also Divi, Ultra, and OceanWP.

To get a curated catalog of templates that support Elementor, install the https://startertemplates.com/?page-builder=elementor Wordpress plugin.

For testing purposes, you can use the "Planet Earth" template from the Starter Templates marketplace. The template will install the pre-defined pages, plugins (i.e. Elementor), and media.
